            Hello, my name is Manar Bouleqcha! Here I have created by own web
            page with the help of my teacher, Br.Ala! I am proud to say that I
            have learned quite a lot in just a couple of weeks. This taught me
            to learn new things, to experiment with them, and gives me
            confidence to be creative. I have also learned that when coding you
            need to have patience, critical or problem solving, resilience, and
            learning to learn its self. Br.Ala has taught me this by authentic
            learning and showing us we are capable even if we come across any
            mistakes. Learning and creating this web page gave me a chance to
            customize and design something extremely fascinating.

          <h2>My Projects</h2>

          <p>
            There are so many projects that are yet to be experienced. As you
            can see, this is one of them. A web page! There are more like games
            and java scripts. I am excited to learn new things inshAllah.

          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            As you might already know my name is Manar. In the beggining, I did
            not know much about creating web pages or coding. Br.Ala has taught
            so many things that I think will help me not just now but later on
            when making other projects. I enjoy learning new things and I will
            seek any opportunity to do so.
